      <p>I'm a <strong>Lawyer</strong> and <strong>Yogini</strong>.</p>
      <p>
        After 6 years of practicing civil and commercial disputes resolution at the Delhi High Court, I decided I wanted to step up and build a life that I love.
        I found Yoga and knew instantly that it was my calling.
        For two years, I practiced daily and decided to become a certified teacher to pass on what I had found.

        As a Yoga teacher, my ultimate goal is to inspire my students to fall deeply in love with the practice itself. My aim is to guide each student towards a point where they become self-sufficient in their practice and no longer need my guidance.
        Through my teachings, I hope to instill this passion and knowledge in each of my students, empowering them to embrace their true potential and live a life of fulfillment.

        Short span of 5 months, taught xyz students dedicating xyz hours to yoga classes.
