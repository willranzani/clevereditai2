Iâ€™m a product guy, a storyteller, with a strong technical background and education, but also with an interest in marketing and great user experience. For me, a transparent work environment where I can contribute on a high level is most exciting.</p><p>I really like cats, they are soft and fluffy. After working for a year at a coffee store, I am now a certified snob. My musical skills are unfortunately absent, but I compensate this with enthusiasm. I write poetry, sometimes, and ride my bicycle.</p>"
